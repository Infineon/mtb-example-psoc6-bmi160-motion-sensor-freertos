# PSoC&trade; 6 MCU: BMI160 motion sensor interfacing using I2C

This example demonstrates how to interface PSoC&trade; 6 MCU with a [BMI160 motion sensor](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/motion-sensors/imus/bmi160.html) over an I2C interface within a FreeRTOS task using the [BMI160 motion sensor library](https://github.com/Infineon/sensor-motion-bmi160). This example reads the raw motion data and estimates the orientation of the board.

This example requires the [BMI160 inertial measurement unit](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/motion-sensors/imus/bmi160.html) to be interfaced with PSoC&trade; 6 MCU using one of the kits mentioned above.


### Interfacing details

There are primarily two ways of interfacing the BMI160 motion sensor with the PSoC&trade; 6 MCU in this code example:

1. **Shields:** [CY8CKIT-028-EPD](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-028-epd) or [CY8CKIT-028-TFT](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-028-tft) *(On some supported kits only):* You can plug in the shield to the PSoC&trade; 6 MCU kit and configure the `INTERFACE_USED` and `BMI160_INTERRUPT_CHANNEL` macros in the *motion_task.h* file as described in the [Operation](#operation) section.

   **Note:** This method of interfacing is not supported by all the kits mentioned in the [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target) section. See **Table 1** for supported interfaces for each supported kit and the corresponding interrupt pin interfacing details.

2. **Direct connection:** Interface the BMI160 motion sensor per the schematic diagram shown in **Figure 1**.

   - Connect the *I2C_SDA* and *I2C_SCL* pins to the kit's I2C pins. See the kit user guide for more details on the kit's I2C configuration.

   - BMI160 provides two interrupt channels (*INT1* and *INT2*) to which various interrupt events can be assigned. Connect either *INT1* or *INT2* pin with a PSoC&trade; 6 MCU GPIO pin, define the `INTERFACE_USED` macro as `CUSTOM_INTERFACE`, and configure the `BMI160_INTERRUPT_CHANNEL` and `CUSTOM_INTERRUPT_PIN` macros as described in the [Operation](#operation) section.

     **Figure 1. BMI160 custom interfacing diagram**

     ![](images/bmi160-custom-interfacing.png)

**Table 1** lists the supported interfaces for each supported kit and the corresponding interrupt pin interfacing details. Note that for the functionality of this code example, you need to use only one of the BMI160's interrupt pins (either INT1 or INT2, not both).

- In case of shields (CY8CKIT-028-EPD and CY8CKIT-028-TFT), the PSoC&trade; 6 GPIO pins that connect to the BMI160's INT1 and INT2 pins are also shown in **Table 1**. The code example automatically configures these GPIO pins when you define the `INTERFACE_USED` macro and the details in the table are for your information only.

- In case of direct interfacing ('CUSTOM_INTERFACE'), you should choose an appropriate GPIO pin to interface INT1 or INT2 (mentioned as *User-defined* in the following table).

**Table 1. BMI160 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU interfacing**

| Development kit | Supported interfaces (`INTERFACE_USED` macro) | PSoC&trade; 6 MCU GPIO pin interfaced with BMI160's INT1 pin | PSoC&trade; 6 MCU GPIO pin interfaced with BMI160's INT2 pin |

<br>

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Notes:**

- The PSoC&trade; 62S1 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CYW9P62S1-43012EVB-01) cannot be used with the CY8CKIT-028-EPD shield to evaluate the complete functionality of this example. This is because this kit does not have any GPIO connections to the D8 and D9 pins compatible with Arduino to which the motion sensor's interrupt pins interface on the CY8CKIT-028-EPD shield.

- The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [firmware loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-psoc6-bmi160-motion-sensor-freertos](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-bmi160-motion-sensor-freertos)" application with the desired name "Bmi160Freertos" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT --app-id mtb-example-psoc6-bmi160-motion-sensor-freertos --user-app-name Bmi160Freertos --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br>

Following example adds the CY8CPROTO-062-4343W BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyHelloWorld" --add-bsp-name CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyHelloWorld" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CPROTO-062-4343W
   ```

## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Interface the BMI160 motion sensor with the kit. See the [Hardware setup](#hardware-setup) section for the interfacing details.

2. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

4. Specify the BMI160 motion sensor configuration details in the *motion_task.h* file as follows:

   1. Modify the `INTERFACE_USED` macro based on how you interface the motion sensor. To know the interfaces supported with your kit, see **Table 1**. For the shields, define the macro as `CY8CKIT_028_EPD` or `CY8CKIT_028_TFT`. If you connect the sensor directly with the PSoC&trade; 6 MCU, define the macro as `CUSTOM_INTERFACE`.

      **Note:** If you use a kit that is not a pioneer kit (pioneer kits have headers compatible with Arduino), choose `CUSTOM_INTERFACE` for this macro.

   2. Specify the interrupt channel (1 or 2) of the BMI160 motion sensor that you want to use in this example using the `BMI160_INTERRUPT_CHANNEL` macro. By default, this macro is set to '1', which corresponds to the INT1 pin.

   3. If you use a custom interface (`INTERFACE_USED` defined as `CUSTOM_INTERFACE`), specify the GPIO pin of PSoC&trade; 6 MCU that interfaces with the BMI160 motion sensor's interrupt pin (INT1 when `BMI160_INTERRUPT_CHANNEL` is 1; INT2 when the macro is 2) by using the `CUSTOM_INTERRUPT_PIN` macro.

      Example:
      ```
      #define CUSTOM_INTERRUPT_PIN      (P10_0)
      ```

5. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

6. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the terminal application displays the code example title and the initial orientation.

   **Figure 2. Terminal showing the initial orientation**

   ![](images/terminal-output.png)

   **Note:** If the terminal displays an error message, check the connection of the motion sensor or EPD/TFT shield with the kit.

   The accelerometer sensor data is used to estimate the boardâ€™s spatial orientation. The terminal application display shows one of the six orientation states: *DISP_UP, DISP_DOWN, TOP_EDGE, BOTTOM_EDGE, LEFT_EDGE, and RIGHT_EDGE*. Side views of the pioneer kit with the EPD shield for each orientation state are shown as follows.

   **Figure 3. Orientation states**

   ![](images/orientation-states.png)

7. Change the orientation of the motion sensor and confirm that the orientation is updated on the same line in the terminal application as illustrated as follows.

   **Figure 4. Terminal output for orientation states**

   ![](images/updated-terminal-output.png)


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice â€“ once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/PSoC-6-MCU-Code-in-main-executes-before-the-debugger-halts-at-the-first-line-of/ta-p/253856) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

[BMI160 motion sensor](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/motion-sensors/imus/bmi160.html) is a low-power inertial measurement unit (IMU) providing 3-axis acceleration and 3-axis gyroscopic measurements. It is present on both the E-INK display shield (CY8CKIT-028-EPD) and the TFT display shield (CY8CKIT-028-TFT). PSoC&trade; 6 MCU interfaces with this sensor and reads the accelerometer data from which the orientation is computed and displayed on the terminal application.

The BMI160 motion sensor is interfaced with PSoC&trade; 6 MCU using an I2C interface and up to two interrupt pins. BMI160 has a hardware-selectable I2C slave address, depending on the logic driven on the SDO pin. On the EPD and TFT shields, the SDO pin is pulled to GND, which selects the slave address 0b1101000 (0x68).

BMI160 provides two interrupt channels (INT1 and INT2) to which various interrupt events can be assigned. In this example, the orientation interrupt is assigned to the interrupt pin that is configured using the `BMI160_INTERRUPT_CHANNEL` macro. See the [BMI160 datasheet](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/motion-sensors/imus/bmi160.html) for details on interrupt outputs.

The BMI160 motion sensor's interrupt output (INT1 or INT2 based on the `BMI160_INTERRUPT_CHANNEL` macro) is configured to provide a rising-edge signal with a pulse width of 5 ms. The motion sensor is configured to provide an interrupt when the orientation is changed. Raw accelerometer data is read and processed on the orientation interrupt to compute the orientation.

On PSoC&trade; 6 MCU, the GPIO pin connected to the motion sensor's interrupt pin (INT1 or INT2 based on the `BMI160_INTERRUPT_CHANNEL` macro) is configured as an input pin to detect rising-edge interrupts. The GPIO pin is automatically chosen by the example depending upon the combination of the kit, shield, and the interrupt channel being used. The shield (or custom interface) being used and the desired interrupt channel to be used can be configured in the *motion_task.h* file as described earlier.


### Code example execution

The main function initializes the BSP and the retarget-io library, and creates the motion sensor task. The task initializes the motion sensor and configures the interrupt. The task reads the accelerometer data, computes the orientation, displays it on the UART console, and then waits indefinitely for a task notification. Upon receiving an interrupt from the motion sensor, the ISR is invoked which notifies the motion sensor task. Then, the task reads the motion sensor data, updates the orientation state, and waits for the notification again. This operation continues indefinitely.


### Resources and settings

An SCB-based resource in I2C mode is configured with the help of I2C HAL APIs to implement the I2C master interface to BMI160. The I2C clock frequency is set to 1 MHz. Configuration of the motion sensor and acquiring the accelerometer information are performed over this interface.

**Table 2. Application resources**

 Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose
 :-------- | :-------------    | :------------
 SCB (I2C) (HAL) | kit_i2c                 | I2C master driver to communicate with the BMI160 motion sensor
 UART (HAL)      | cy_retarget_io_uart_obj | UART HAL object used by retarget-io for the debug UART port
 GPIO (HAL)      | BMI160_INTERRUPT_PIN    | Motion sensor interrupt pin
